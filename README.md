Replication of Sims and Wu (2019) four-equation NK model (Nonlinear version)  
1. Sims.mod and Sims_steadystate.m are programs for simulation in the normal setting.  
2. Sims_occ.mod and Sims_occ_steadystate.m are programs for simulation in the ELB(Efficient Lower Bond) by occbin toolkit.
3. Sims_deter.mod and Sims_deter_steadystate.m are programs for simulation in the ELB by deterministic simulation. （working in progress）
